## Questions/Tradeoffs
* Do we manage the istio/virtual service side of things?
* Or do we let helm do it and we just allow for the steps/flow?
  * What do we consider steps/flow?
    * Templates?
    * Steps/stages etc?
    * Inputs from existing deployment/cluster-how to work in?
  * Install a helm chart and upgrade another? Upgrade a single chart?
    * Do we want this to be configurable, or just one chart?
  * What options do we have and what opinions do we want?
    * We want values from a library file.
    * What about manually specified?
    * File upload?
* How do we want to do test running?
  * Helm tests?
  * Another chart?
  * Run a container? (which we probably make into a pod?)
  * What to do with results?
