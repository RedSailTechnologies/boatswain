### NOTES ###
#############
# Everything in an array other than the clusters list can be substituted for a template, to
# include: apps, tests, triggers, and strategies.

# This means that a deployment can be an aggregation of a bunch of different templates, overwriting
# and specifying values as needed either by an input file or parameters from triggers

# .Inputs vs .Parameters
# Inputs come from merging a template with another file when setting up a deployment, or specified
# when calling a template from another template. An easy way to think of them are compile-time variables.
# Parameters on the other hand are decidedly runtime variables-coming from trigger inputs or manually
# specified values at runtime.

### METADATA ###
################

# the version of this deployment, note this won't impact parts of the deployment
# unless they use it but it should probably be unique for each deployment
version: ${{ .Parameters.version }}

# the names of clusters currently configured in bosn - these can be added through 
# the ui or specified as a configuration file on installing bosn but must be in
# this list prior to execution of the deployment
clusters:
  - dev
  - staging

# apps are one of the objects we can use in a strategy, meant for long-lived applications/changes
apps:
  - name: sample-app # the name of the app, used with helm and with bosn output
    helm: # specifics of this application
      chart: sample-app # the name of the chart for the app
      repo: myrepo # the name of the helm repo, note this must be configured in bosn
      version: ${{ .Parameters.sampleAppChartVersion }} # the version of the chart, note the template syntax
  
  # the name of another template in boatswain, note the path@branch syntax
  - template: path/to/default-app.yaml
    branch: branch
    repo: git-repo # name of the git repo to find this template in
    # these will populate in the template under the Inputs object
    arguments:
      version: '1.0.1' # example usage inside the template: ${{ .Inputs.version }}

# tests are another object we can use in a strategy, not meant to be long lived, but otherwise are
# the same as apps in their specs
tests:
  # tests can be specified much like an app, the expectation here is that this is a job or 
  # collection of jobs, and after the install with wait the tests should be done
